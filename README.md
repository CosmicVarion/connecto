This repository contains an implementation of Candy Crush in Python 3 with an object-oriented design.

To play, run the driver:
> python3 driver.py
You may optionally provide a board dimension as a command line argument.
> python3 driver.py 7
The board by default is 5 by 5. 

The front end relies on tkinter. To install for Python 3, you may use this command: 
> sudo apt-get install python3-tk
